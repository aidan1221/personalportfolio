                Gothello was a made up game that is a blend of Go and Othello, played on a 5x5 gameboard. For this project I was tasked 
                with building an AI player that could effectively compete in the game of Gothello. In order to accomplish this task, 
                my partner and I implemented what is called a depth-limited minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. To improve the player
                 we also had to explore various game heuristics that could inform the scoring algorithm of the player.

                Pure data is a graphical programming language that allows you to manipulate the digital 
                signal processing of various tools with custom C code. For this project, I built my own 
                modular synthesizer with audio sampling capabilities, high, low, and bandpass filters, a beat
                machine, and arpeggiator.

                This project was the result of my Capstone project for the New Beginnings program. Using the NLTK library for python, 
                I utilized various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to implement a fairly rudimentary chatbot called StupidBot.
                It used a Naive Bayes Classifier to tag parts of speech in the user's input, then found relevant keywords by mapping word similarity
                 with the help of a large NLP corpus called WordNet. With these techniques, StupidBot could engage the user in conversation about a 
                 topic by asking succesively more detailed questions until the user responded with "I don't know," at which point StupidBot would
                  provide the Wikipedia article on the topic at hand.
