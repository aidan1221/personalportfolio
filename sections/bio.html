                    Avocado is a 2 year old veiled chameleon, also known as a Yemen chameleon. This species of chameleon is interesting
                    because it comes from a tropical rainforest located near the coast of Yemen (people are often surprised that such a 
                    place exists). She can change the color of her skin, but it is a misconception to assume that this is for camoflauge 
                    purposes. The natural tones of her skin are indeed meant for camoflauge, but the changes in the color of her skin are 
                    actually a result of mood and environment rather than something actively undertaken for camoflauge.
